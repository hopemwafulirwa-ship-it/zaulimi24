System Design Document (SDD) for Zaulimi24 E-commerce Site
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document provides a high-level architectural overview and technical design for the Zaulimi24 e-commerce platform. It outlines the major components, their interactions, and the key technologies required to build a system that meets the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the SRS.
1.2 Architectural Goals
The primary architectural goals are:
•	Scalability: The system must be able to handle a growing number of users and transactions.
•	Maintainability: The codebase should be modular and easy for developers to understand and modify.
•	Security: User data and transactions must be protected.
•	Performance: The platform must provide a fast and responsive user experience.
2. Architectural Overview: Three-Tier Architecture
The system will follow a Three-Tier Architecture, a proven model for building scalable web applications. This architecture separates the application into three logical and physical layers: the Presentation Layer, the Application Layer, and the Data Layer.
•	Presentation Layer (Frontend): This is the user-facing part of the Zaulimi24 application. It runs in the user's web browser and is responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions. It will communicate with the Application Layer via a RESTful API.
•	Application Layer (Backend): This layer contains the core business logic. It processes requests from the frontend, interacts with the database, and handles third-party service integrations (like payment gateways). This will be a stateless API service.
•	Data Layer (Database): This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving all application data, including user profiles, product information, and order details.
3. Component Breakdown
3.1 Frontend
•	Technology: We will use Next.js, a powerful React framework that provides a robust solution for building dynamic web applications. Next.js offers key features like Server-Side Rendering (SSR), which is crucial for SEO and performance in an e-commerce context. The entire frontend will be built with TypeScript for improved code quality and maintainability.
•	Key Components:
o	User Module: Handles login, registration, and profile management.
o	Product Catalog: Displays all products, provides search/filter functionality, and manages product details pages.
o	Shopping Cart: Manages adding, removing, and updating products before checkout.
o	Checkout Flow: Guides the user through the payment and shipping process.
o	Seller Dashboard: Provides an interface for sellers to manage products and orders.
3.2 Backend (Application Layer)
•	Technology: A Node.js with Express.js framework is a suitable choice for its speed and asynchronous nature, ideal for I/O-heavy operations like API calls to a database.
•	Core Services:
o	Authentication Service: Manages user registration, login, and sessions using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
o	Product Service: Handles all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to products.
o	Order Service: Manages the entire order lifecycle, from cart to checkout to fulfillment.
o	Payment Service: Acts as an intermediary between the Order Service and a third-party payment gateway (Stripe is a strong candidate).
3.3 Database (Data Layer)
•	Technology: A NoSQL document database like Cloud Firestore is recommended. Its real-time synchronization capabilities are a major advantage for both user interfaces and a seller's dashboard.
•	Rationale: Firestore's schemaless nature allows for rapid iteration during the MVP phase. It's also fully managed, which reduces operational overhead.
•	Data Models (Collections):
o	users: Stores user profiles. Fields: id, email, passwordHash, role, name, address.
o	products: Stores product details. Fields: id, sellerId, name, description, price, stock, imageUrl, category.
o	orders: Stores order information. Fields: id, buyerId, sellerId, items (an array of objects with productId and quantity), totalAmount, status, timestamp.
o	reviews: Stores user reviews. Fields: id, productId, userId, rating, comment, timestamp.
4. API Design (High-Level Endpoints)
The backend will expose a RESTful API to the frontend. All communication will be stateless and authenticated using JWTs.
•	POST /api/auth/register - Create a new user account.
•	POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate a user and return a JWT.
•	GET /api/products - Retrieve all products (with optional filtering/sorting).
•	GET /api/products/:id - Retrieve a single product by ID.
•	POST /api/products - Create a new product (Seller-only).
•	GET /api/cart - Get the current user's cart contents.
•	POST /api/cart - Add an item to the cart.
•	POST /api/orders - Create a new order (Checkout).
•	GET /api/orders/:id - Get order details.
5. Security and Infrastructure
•	Authentication: JWTs will be used for session management. Passwords will be hashed using a strong algorithm like bcrypt before being stored.
•	Transport: All network traffic will be secured using HTTPS/SSL encryption.
•	Validation: All API endpoints will perform input validation to prevent malicious data injection and errors.
•	Hosting: A scalable cloud platform like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Firebase is recommended. Firebase provides a comprehensive suite of tools (Firestore, Authentication, Hosting) that aligns perfectly with this design, especially for an MVP.
