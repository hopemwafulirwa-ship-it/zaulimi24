Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Zaulimi24 E-commerce Site
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for a web-based e-commerce platform named Zaulimi24, designed to facilitate the direct sale of fresh farm produce from local sellers to consumers. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for buyers to browse and purchase products and a robust backend for sellers to manage their inventory and sales.
1.2 Scope
The system will be a single, cohesive web application accessible via modern web browsers. It will include separate interfaces for buyers and sellers, and an administrative dashboard for overall system management.
•	In Scope: User registration, product browsing, searching, shopping cart management, secure checkout, order history, seller product listing, and basic sales reporting.
•	Out of Scope: Mobile applications (iOS/Android), complex inventory management systems (e.g., FIFO), advanced analytics, and integrated logistics/delivery services beyond basic order tracking.
1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
•	SRS: Software Requirements Specification
•	Buyer: A registered user who purchases products.
•	Seller: A registered user who lists and sells farm produce.
•	Product: A single farm produce item listed by a seller (e.g., "1kg organic tomatoes").
•	UI/UX: User Interface/User Experience
•	QA: Quality Assurance
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
This system is a self-contained web application. It will interface with external services for payment processing (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) but will not depend on any other major existing software components.
2.2 Product Functions
The primary functions of the system are:
•	Allow buyers to browse and search for produce.
•	Provide a shopping cart for managing selections.
•	Facilitate a secure checkout process.

•	Provide order management and tracking for both buyers and sellers.
•	Support a rating and review system.
2.3 User Characteristics
•	Buyer: The target audience is a general consumer interested in fresh, local produce. They will be comfortable with basic web navigation and e-commerce transactions.
•	Seller: Farmers or small-scale produce vendors. They may have limited technical expertise and require an intuitive interface for managing their listings.
•	Admin: The system administrator responsible for overseeing all users and content. This user will have full access to all data and system functions.
2.4 Constraints
•	Platform: The application will be web-only.
•	Technology Stack: The core technology stack will be based on a single-page application (SPA) framework on the frontend and a scalable backend architecture. Specific technologies will be defined in the System Design Document.
•	Timeline: The initial version (Minimum Viable Product - MVP) should be completed within six months.
