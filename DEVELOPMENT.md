# Development Guide

This document provides guidelines and procedures for developing the Zaulimi24 platform.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd zaulimi24
   ```

2. Run the initialization script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/init-project.sh
   ./scripts/init-project.sh
   ```

3. Copy and configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow the Gitflow workflow:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `hotfix/*` - Hotfix branches
- `release/*` - Release branches

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Code Standards

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Write JSDoc comments for functions and classes

#### CSS/Tailwind
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create custom components when needed
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

#### API Design
- Follow RESTful principles
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Return consistent JSON responses
- Implement proper error handling

### Database Design

- Use PostgreSQL for relational data
- Follow normalization principles
- Create indexes for frequently queried fields
- Use migrations for schema changes

## Testing

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/          # Unit tests
├── integration/   # Integration tests
├── e2e/           # End-to-end tests
└── fixtures/      # Test data
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Deployment

### Staging Environment

1. Merge feature branches to `develop`
2. Deploy to staging environment
3. Perform QA testing

### Production Deployment

1. Create a release branch from `develop`
2. Merge release branch to `main`
3. Create a Git tag
4. Deploy to production environment

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

- Run tests on every push
- Build and deploy on merge to `develop` and `main`
- Security scanning for dependencies

## Monitoring and Logging

- Use Winston for application logging
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Application performance monitoring with New Relic
- Error tracking with Sentry

## Security

- Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- Use helmet.js for HTTP headers
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Store secrets in environment variables

## Performance Optimization

- Implement caching with Redis
- Use CDN for static assets
- Optimize database queries
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use compression middleware
- Optimize images and assets

## Code Review Process

1. Create a pull request
2. Assign reviewers
3. Address feedback
4. Merge after approval

Review checklist:
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Performance impact is considered
